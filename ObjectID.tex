\section{Object selection}
\label{sec:ObjectSelection}
In this Section we document the electron, 
and photon identification and isolation criteria, MET criteria, and provide the
results of comparing Monte Carlo simulation with data.


\subsection{Electron selection}
\label{sec:eid}
In $W\gamma$ analysis we consider electrons with $p_T > 30$~GeV and passing
the Medium-identification and isolation optimized by EGamma-POG for 2012 analyses.
We summarize electron identification and isolation requirements in Table~\ref{}.

The ECAL fiducial region is defined in terms of barrel and endcap
sections with pseudorapidity ranges of $|\eta| < 1.4442$ and  
$1.566 < |\eta| < 2.5$, respectively. An electron is considered
to be within this ECAL acceptance if its associated SuperCluster (SC) is
within the ECAL acceptance.
Data/MC scale factors are applied.


\subsection{Photon selection}
Photon candidates are reconstructed as SuperClusters with 
$E_{T} > 15$~GeV in the fiducial volume of the ECAL detector:
barrel (EB) with $|\eta|<1.4442$ and endcap (EE) with 
$1.566 < |\eta| < 2.5$. To reduce copious background objects from jets misidentified as photons 
we apply the Medium identification and isolation selections as recommended by EGamma-POG.
Data/MC scale factors are applied.

\subsection{MET}
